            <p>Here you will find the details of the study. There will be a total of 16 examples that will be shown to you,
                where you need to identify why the robot was unable to identify the provided goal, failure state or unable
                to satisfy the conditions required to do the action. Each example is independent from each other. Press "Start Experiment" to start</p>
<p> In the trial example, please note the completely opaque objects are blocks and the objects with labels on them with hollow boxes are locations. (post examples here)
