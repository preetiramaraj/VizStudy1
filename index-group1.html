            <ul>
                    <li>There will be a total 12 examples that will be shown to you. In each of these examples, a mentor is trying to teach a goal state, failure state
                    or an action to a robot.</li>
                    <li> However, the robot is unable to detect the goal in its environment or it is unable to do the action the mentor is trying to teach.</li>
                    <li><b>Your goal is to identify why the robot was unable to do this. This task will take about 20 minutes.</b></li>
                    <li>You will write down text identifying the reason and your goal is to select the most precise answer from the drop down before submitting the answer. </li>
                    <li>Each example is independent from each other. Each example should not take you more than 2 minutes.</li>
               <li> Based on the example, you will be provided with options (Showing concepts and asking questions) that you can use to gain more information about the robot. The goal is to answer as many questions correctly as possible. Use these options to validate your answer. For example, "Show clear" will show all objects that are "clear".</li>
            </ul>
                <p> In each of these examples, you will see an image like the one presented below. 
            In this image, there are total 6 objects. The completely opaque green objects are "blocks" and the brown objects with labels loc1, loc2 and loc3 on them with hollow boxes are locations.
                All objects typically have ids associated with them. In this case, the green blocks have ids 8, 9 and 10 and the brown locations have ids 1, 2 and 3.</p>

            <p> You will receive a code at the end of the experiment which you must enter in order to get compensated. Press "Start Experiment" to start.
